# Agriculture-Production-Cooperative


About Agriculture cooperative - A cooperative where farmers pool their resources in certain areas of activity.  In Agriculture Production Cooperative specifically, 
production resources (land, machinery) are pooled and members of the co-op farm jointly.

This project is based on the software required for Agriculture Production Cooperative system. It deals with the records of assets of farmers who have decided to practice farming by pooling their resources among themselves (take part in Agriculture Production Cooperative), and the allocation of resources among the groups of farmers. The whole system has been formed using the Python-MySQL Interface. 

This system can be used by a group of 2-10 farmers (members) and is run by an admin, the system takes inputs from the user and performs various tasks like,

- maintaining an inventory of resources (recording counts, maintenance costs, 
  servicing dates etc.),
- comprehensive data of members' individual resource contributions,
- updating information of crops to be produced,
- creating subgroups of members, and allocating them the crop to be produced 
  (along with providing the resources required for production of the crop),
- generating an yearly data of total crop yield (on monsoon, summer and winter 
  basis),
- dividing the crop yields among members in ratio of their input (resource) 
  contribution (this part of the system needs more efficiency),
- generating individual crop yield shares of the members.

The main motive of this system is to provide a solution to reduce intensive farming over a small area of land and help farmers make more profit from existing resources.
